# mindOS

## What is it?

mindOS is a new take on an operating systems and this is its tech demo. The basic premises is that if speech was a core component of an operating system, not just an after thought, then it would be possible to make user interaction much more natural while still providing a screen to interact with.

## What is cljfx

cljfx is the library we have decided to use that makes building Clojure GUI applications possible and fairly straight forward. We are using it in the hopes of building an entirely Clojure based front-end tech demo.

## Short Term Goals

The short term goal is to get a demo of what the visuals will be up and running as quickly as possible. We believe this is possible before the end of November.

## Who is Working on It?

At the moment it is just myself but I hope to expand the people interested in the project in the near future.
